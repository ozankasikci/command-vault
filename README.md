## Installation

### From Releases

You can download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/command-vault/releases).

#### Linux and macOS
```bash
# Download the latest release (replace X.Y.Z with the version number)
curl -LO https://github.com/yourusername/command-vault/releases/download/v0.1.5/command-vault-linux-amd64
# Make it executable
chmod +x command-vault-linux-amd64
# Move it to your PATH
sudo mv command-vault-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/command-vault

# Initialize shell integration (add to your .bashrc or .zshrc)
source "$(command-vault shell-init)"
```

#### Windows
Download the Windows executable from the releases page and add it to your PATH.

### Shell Integration

Command Vault needs to be integrated with your shell to automatically track commands. Add this to your shell's RC file:

```bash
# For Bash (~/.bashrc)
source "$(command-vault shell-init)"

# For Zsh (~/.zshrc)
source "$(command-vault shell-init)"
```

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source, you'll need Rust installed on your system:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/command-vault.git
cd command-vault

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# The binary will be available in target/release/command-vault
```

Add the following to your shell's configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   source "$(command-vault shell-init)"
   ```

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
cargo test
```

### Code Coverage
```bash
# Generate coverage report (requires cargo-tarpaulin)
./scripts/coverage.sh

# View the report in your browser
open coverage/tarpaulin-report.html
```

## Shell Aliases

For easier access, you can add aliases to your shell configuration:

### For Bash/Zsh (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
```bash
# to use as cmdv:
alias cmdv='command-vault'
# or to use as cv:
alias cv='command-vault'
```

After adding the aliases, restart your shell or run:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # for Zsh
source ~/.bashrc # for Bash
```

Now you can use shorter commands:
```bash
cv add 'echo Hello'
cmdv ls
```
